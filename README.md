# SemantiUI-Boilerplate

> A simple SemantiUI project boilerplate with clear and useful gulp tasks.

## Install
Simply type `npm install` from the repository root to install all SemantiUI and tasks dependencies.

SemantiUI is installed by using the [official npm method](http://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html), and after the installation it is available under the `/semantic` directory, so you can configure its styles and your site as usual.

## Usage
Type `gulp help` to see all available tasks.

The boilerplate exposes two SemantiUI tasks to build and watch SemantiUI changes as documented in the [recipes](http://semantic-ui.com/introduction/advanced-usage.html)

## TODO
* Build Task
* README doc
